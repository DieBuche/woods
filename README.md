Woods
=====

Woods is a static site generator inspired by [Kirby](http://getkirby.com/) & [Stacey](http://www.staceyapp.com/).

Features:

*   DOM like structure with parents and children
*   Uses express to serve locally on localhost:3000
*   Reloads automatically whenever a content or template file is changed
*   Jade templates

Todo:

*   Reload the page automatically when Woods is reloaded
*   Generate & upload html to S3
*   Custom tags
*   Thumbnails

Lots of work left to be done.
